# tdxpower v1.0.1
# Â© 2024 Dunspixel

# This is a recreation of the code used to calculate Power in Tetris DX, based on my analysis of the assembly code.
# The original source code was probably a lot simpler and easy to understand than this.

# Single game power can be calculated from Score, Lines, and Soft-Drop points.
# This is then added to (profile power * min(games played, 5)) and divided by min(games played, 5) + 1.

# Currently, this only works for Marathon and Ultra modes.
# There's some extra logic which is applied for 40Lines mode, but I haven't analysed that yet.
