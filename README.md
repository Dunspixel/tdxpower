Calculator and analysis for power in Tetris DX

This is my analysis of the assembly code used to calculate Power in Tetris DX, plus a calculator which recreates it.

It's my first time trying to analyse and reverse-engineer assembly code, so I'm not very good at it.

I hope this makes sense to people who know GB assembly better than me!
