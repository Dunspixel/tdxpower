# tdxpower
This is my analysis of the assembly code used to calculate Power in Tetris DX, plus a calculator which recreates it.

It's my first time trying to analyse and reverse-engineer assembly code, so I'm not very good at it.

I hope this makes sense to people who know GB assembly better than me!

Note: There's some extra logic for 40Lines mode which I haven't looked into yet. I will implement this later.
